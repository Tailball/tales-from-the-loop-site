            <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
            <div class="action animated-left">
                <p>Simon Stålenhag is the internationally lauded artist and author of Tales From the Loop and Things From the Flood, narrative art books that stunned the world with a vision of an alternate Scandinavia in the 1980s and ‘90s, where technology invaded tranquil landscapes to form an entirely new universe of the eerie and the nostalgic.</p>
                <p>On April 3, the tv series based on Stålenhag’s work launched on Amazon Prime Video, starring Rebecca Hall (Vicky Cristina Barcelona), Paul Schneider (Parks and Recreation), and Jonathan Pryce (Game of Thrones).</p>
                <p>The Tales From the Loop RPG was released in 2017 and was a big hit, winning no less than five Gold ENnies, including Best Game and Product of the Year. In this tabletop roleplaying game, you play teenagers solving spectacular mysteries connected to the Loop – just make sure you’re home in time for dinner. On June 2, 2020, we launched a new boxed Starter Set for the RPG.</p>

            <div class="action animated-left">
                <p>In 1954, the Swedish government ordered the construction of the world’s largest particle accelerator. The facility was complete in 1969, located deep below the pastoral countryside of Mälaröarna. The local population called this marvel of technology The Loop.</p>
                <p>In this roleplaying game, you play teenagers in the late Eighties, solving Mysteries connected to the Loop. Choose between character Types such as the Bookworm, the Troublemaker, the Popular Kid and the Weirdo. Everyday Life is full of nagging parents, never-ending homework and classmates bullying and being bullied. Explore the secrets of the Loop in two main game settings – one based on the Swedish Mälaren Islands, the other on Boulder City, Nevada.</p>
                <p>The Mysteries let the characters encounter the strange machines and weird creatures that have come to haunt the countryside after the Loop was built. The kids get to escape their everyday problems and be part of something meaningful and magical – but also dangerous.</p>
